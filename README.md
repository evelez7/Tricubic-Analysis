# Tricubic Analysis
Tricubic Analysis was built to observe the accuracy of tricubic, a tricubic interpolation library developed by Francois Lekien and Jerrold Marsden at Caltech.
I built it as part of my independent study in the spring of 2020.

Included in the repo is a report, `tric_analysis`.
It provides some context for the program and a brief overview of the theory behind tricubic which is introduced by Lekien and Marsden in their 2005 article.

Thank you to Dr. Henry Boateng for his guidance in my first semester of research.
